# SQL-Business-Analysis
# Project README

## Overview

This project involves the transformation and analysis of data using SQL. The primary steps include cleaning the data, writing SQL queries to modify and organize the datasets, and finally creating an interactive chart using Google Looker Studio.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - The project began with five csv sheets containing messy and unstructured data.
   - Extensive data cleaning was performed to standardize and format the information for further analysis.

2. **SQL Queries:**
   - Utilized SQL to write queries for modifying and organizing the cleaned datasets.
   
3. **Dataset Modification:**
   - Employed SQL to modify the five datasets into two that are much cleaner and more useful.
   - This step ensured that the data is prepared and structured appropriately for the subsequent visualization phase.

4. **Google Looker Studio:**
   - Leveraged Google Looker Studio to create an interactive chart.
   - Two charts were created. One is a report on the Sales/Order Analytics and the other is a report on the Staff.

## Tools Used

- **Numbers:** Initial data was in five csv sheets.
- **SQL:** Used for data cleaning, modification, and organization.
- **Google Looker Studio:** Employed for creating an interactive chart based on the modified datasets.

## How to Use

- The repository contains the datasets pre-cleaning, post-cleaning, and then modified by the queries.
- The two queries are also in this file to show the code using to modify the data.
- Finally, There are two Looker Studio links which lead to the BI charts.  

## Additional Notes

- The Data was acquired through Dave's Hot Chicken.
- It was modified to not include any real staff names or sales.
- Thus, the datasets and interactive charts do not directly represent this business - It was just a project made for fun.
- The data given was only representative of a single business day and cannot be adjusted over time as a result.
- Feel free to adapt the SQL queries and steps based on the specifics of your project and dataset.
